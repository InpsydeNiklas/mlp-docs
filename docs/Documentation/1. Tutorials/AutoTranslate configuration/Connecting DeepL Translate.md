## Key Configuration Steps

1. **Activate DeepL**:
    
    - To begin, navigate to the **AutoTranslate** section in MultilingualPress settings.
    - Check the box labeled **Activate DeepL** to enable the DeepL translation service on your site.
2. **Enter DeepL API Key**:
    
    - DeepL requires an API key to authenticate your requests.
    - If you don’t have an API key yet, sign up for a DeepL account on their website. You can use the free API plan for up to 500,000 characters per month, or choose the Pro version for unrestricted access.
    - Once you have the API key, enter it into the **API Key** field in the DeepL configuration section of MultilingualPress.
3. **Save Changes**:
    
    - After entering your DeepL API key, click **Save** to apply the settings. DeepL is now ready to translate your site’s content automatically.

## Purpose and Use

- **Automatic Translation**:  
    DeepL’s integration in MultilingualPress automates the translation of content in your multilingual site. Once activated, it translates content as new posts or pages are created, minimizing manual translation efforts.
    
- **High-Quality Translations**:  
    DeepL is known for its exceptional translation accuracy, ensuring your site’s content is both natural-sounding and contextually accurate in over 25 languages.
    

## Considerations

- **Free vs. Pro Plans**:
    
    - The **Free Plan** allows up to **500,000 characters per month**. If your site requires more translations, consider upgrading to the **DeepL Pro** plan for more characters and additional features.
- **Character Limits**:  
    Keep an eye on your character usage to avoid hitting the free tier’s limit. Once exceeded, DeepL may stop translating until the limit is reset or you upgrade to a paid plan.
    
- **Security**:  
    Ensure your API key is kept secure. Do not expose it in public areas or repository files. This key is essential for activating the service and should be treated with care to prevent unauthorized use.
    

## Troubleshooting

- **Invalid API Key**:  
    If your API key is incorrect, DeepL will fail to translate content. Double-check your key, especially if you have recently switched plans or updated your DeepL account credentials.
    
- **Translation Failures**:  
    If the translation isn’t working, verify that your API key is valid and that you are within the free tier character limits. You may also check DeepL’s service status in case there are temporary outages.
    

## Conclusion

Connecting DeepL Translate within MultilingualPress offers an easy and efficient way to provide high-quality automatic translations for your website. By following the setup steps and managing your API key securely, you can ensure a seamless translation experience for international users.
