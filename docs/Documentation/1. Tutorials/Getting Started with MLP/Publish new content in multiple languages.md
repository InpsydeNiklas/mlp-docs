# Create and Translate Content Across Languages

**Purpose:** Guide content authors through creating and translating posts (and related taxonomies) across different language sites in your network.

---

### 1. Create Content on Your Main (or Any) Site

1. **Go to the Dashboard** of the site where you’d like to add a new post or page.
2. In the left menu, select **Posts** → **Add New** (or **Pages** → **Add New**).
3. Write your content, add categories and tags (if needed), and click **Publish** as you normally would in WordPress.

---

### 2. Translate Your Categories and Tags

If you create new categories or tags (taxonomies) for this content, you can translate them before or after publishing:

1. **Edit the Category or Tag** on the original site.
2. Scroll down to the **MultilingualPress Translation** metaboxes for each connected language site.
3. Select **Create a new term, and use it as translation** under the relevant language.
4. Provide the translated name (and slug if applicable).
5. Repeat for all languages, then click **Update**.

> **Tip:** Translating taxonomies ensures that your categories and tags are consistent across all languages and helps with navigation.

MultilingualPress will create the corresponding categories/tags in each language site, linking them together.

### 3. Translate the Post (or Page) Content

Once your post is published, scroll down to the **MultilingualPress Translation** metabox(es) on the edit screen of your original post:

1. Under each language’s metabox, select **Create a new post, and use it as translation**.
2. **Title and Content**:
    - Enter a translation for the title.
    - (Optional) Check the box to duplicate the existing content if you want to translate it later within the new site.
3. **Taxonomies**: Select which categories/tags to sync with the newly created site.
4. **Advanced** (Optional): Choose a publish status for the translated post (e.g., draft or published).
5. Click **Update** on the original post to finalize the translation creation.

MultilingualPress will now generate a draft or published version of the same post on each connected language site, already linked to the correct categories/tags.

---

### 4. Refine Translations in Each Language Site

For more accurate translations:

1. **Visit the Dashboard** of each language site.
2. Find the newly created post (or page).
3. Replace any duplicated content with its proper translation.
4. Save or publish updates.

> **Tip:** MultilingualPress can automatically translate your WordPress content with the AutoTranslate integration.

Your multilingual sites now have the same content in multiple languages, linked together so readers can switch easily between them.

---

### **Next Steps:**

- **Customize how translated content is displayed or linked**: Use the [Quicklinks or the Language Menu Block](#) to manage how users navigate between languages.
- **Explore advanced settings**, such as **syncing comments** and **redirecting visitors by language**.

---

### **Tips & Best Practices**

- **Start Simple**: Create and translate a single post or page to practice the workflow.
- **Consistency is Key**: Use the same category/tag structure across languages to keep content organized.
- **Monitor SEO**: With multiple sites, ensure each language site has correct meta tags and hreflang attributes (MultilingualPress helps with this automatically if configured correctly).

> **Tip:** MultilingualPress works well with all popular SEO plugins such as Yoast SEO.

With these steps, authors and content managers can seamlessly create and translate posts, pages, and taxonomies across multiple languages—without ever losing track of relationships between the sites.
