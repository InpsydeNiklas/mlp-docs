This section of our documentation contains step-by-step tutorials to help outline what MultilingualPress is capable of while helping you achieve specific aims, such as installing MultilingualPress or setting up your Multisite network.

We hope our tutorials make as few assumptions as possible and are broadly accessible to anyone with an interest in MultilingualPress. They should also be a good place to start learning about MultilingualPress, how it works and what it’s capable of.


If you have a specific goal, but are already familiar with MultilingualPress, take a look at our _How-to_ guides. These have more in-depth detail and can be applied to a broader set of applications.

Take a look at our _Reference section_ when you need to know which options can be used or what functions the MultilingualPress API supports for you to build solutions with custom requirements.

Finally, for a better understanding of how MultilingualPress works and how it can be used and configured, our _Explanation_ section enables you to expand your knowledge.
