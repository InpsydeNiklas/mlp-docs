## 2. Requirements & Compatibility

### **Which WordPress & PHP Versions Are Needed?**
We recommend using **WordPress 6.5** or higher, with **PHP 8.0+** (or preferably the latest stable version). This ensures optimal performance and compatibility with MultilingualPress.

### **Do I Need a WordPress Multisite?**
Yes. MultilingualPress requires **WordPress Multisite** to function, as each language will be set up on its own subsite. If you're new to multisite, refer to our guide on [How to Install WordPress Multisite](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/how-to-install-wordpress-multisite/).

### **Does It Work with WP Multisite Domain Mapping?**
Yes, MultilingualPress fully supports **WordPress Multisite Domain Mapping**, a core feature since WordPress 4.5.

### **Is MultilingualPress Compatible with the Block Editor (Gutenberg)?**
Yes, **MultilingualPress 3.0+** fully supports the **Block Editor (Gutenberg)**. It also remains compatible with the **Classic Editor**, should you choose to keep it enabled.

### **What About Page Builders Like Elementor or Beaver Builder?**
MultilingualPress integrates seamlessly with popular page builders like **Elementor**, **Beaver Builder**, and **WPBakery**. You can easily link or duplicate page-builder-created content across your language sites. However, some specialized fields may require manual adjustments or additional configuration.

## 3. Features & Functionality

### **Does MultilingualPress Translate My Content Automatically?**
MultilingualPress doesn’t translate content automatically by default. It links separate language sites within your multisite network. You can manage translations manually or use professional translation tools. Starting with **MLP 5.0**, we’re introducing the **AutoTranslate** feature, integrating with third-party APIs (e.g., Google Translate, Deepl) to automate text translation.

### **How Do I Create a New Language Site?**
To create a new language site, go to **Network Admin → Sites → Add New**, select the language and site to base the new one on. You can also choose to **“Activate all plugins that are active on the source site”** or **“Copy attachments”**. Our [Getting Started guide](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/getting-started-with-multilingualpress-3/) has step-by-step instructions.

### **Can I Copy Media Automatically Between Sites?**
Yes. When duplicating a page or an entire site, you can select **“Copy attachments”**. MultilingualPress will duplicate media files (like images and galleries) to the target site’s media library and automatically update the URLs.

### **What About SEO & Translations?**
MultilingualPress includes an **SEO meta sync** module that works with popular SEO plugins (e.g., Yoast, Rank Math). It allows you to edit SEO meta fields (title, description, etc.) across languages from a single location. Additionally, **hreflang** attributes are automatically inserted to help improve multilingual SEO.

### **How About Stock Synchronization in WooCommerce?**
Each WooCommerce site within your multisite network operates as a separate store, which means product stock isn’t shared by default. To synchronize stock across sites, consider using the [Central Stock for WooCommerce](https://wp-centralstock.com/) plugin.

## 4. WooCommerce & MultilingualPress

### **Is MultilingualPress Compatible with WooCommerce?**
Yes. You can translate products, product categories, and tags across languages. Each language site maintains its own WooCommerce settings (currency, shipping, taxes). For more details, see our [WooCommerce tutorial](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/getting-started-with-multilingualpress-3/?#Translating-WooCommerce-products).

### **Does MultilingualPress Convert Product Prices?**
No, MultilingualPress doesn’t handle price conversion. Pricing must be managed individually on each store, or you can use a currency conversion plugin to adjust prices. MultilingualPress focuses on linking translations, not currency conversion.

### **Is the Shopping Cart Shared Across Languages?**
No, each language site has its own shopping cart. This means that items added to the cart in the English store won't appear in the French store’s cart. Most users prefer this setup for handling separate checkouts per region or language.

### **Any Differences Between Buying on WooCommerce.com vs. MultilingualPress.org?**
There is no difference in the plugin itself or the support you’ll receive, regardless of whether you buy from WooCommerce.com or multilingualpress.org.

## 5. Upgrades & Versions

### **What About Old Versions Like MultilingualPress 2?**
Legacy versions (such as MLP 2) are no longer actively developed. They only receive minimal security updates. We recommend upgrading to **MLP 3.0+** for better performance, block editor support, and ongoing improvements. Migration tools are available [here](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/multilingualpress-2-3-migration-tool/).

### **Does the AutoTranslate Feature Require an Extra License?**
The basic **AutoTranslate** feature is included in **MLP 5.0**. Usage fees may depend on the translation API provider you select.
