**Overview**:  
The **Translatable Taxonomies** tab functions similarly to its Post Types counterpart but focuses on taxonomy terms. Taxonomies—such as categories, tags, or custom taxonomies—govern content classification. By selecting taxonomies here, you enable the translation and linking of taxonomy terms across sites.

**Key Points**:

- **Selection Impact**: Only taxonomies marked as translatable will display translation management options when editing terms. This allows you to link categories, tags, or other taxonomy terms across languages.
- **Customization**: Administrators can choose which taxonomies should be connected across languages, ensuring that only relevant classification systems are translated and linked.
- **Consistency**: Selecting important taxonomies as translatable ensures consistent categorization of content in all languages, which can improve navigation and SEO on multilingual sites.

**When to Use**:

- If your site uses multiple categories, tags, or custom taxonomies and you want to maintain consistent taxonomy structures across languages.
- To prevent unnecessary translation options for taxonomies that are not used for multilingual purposes.

**Conclusion**:  
The **Translatable Taxonomies** tab allows administrators to define which taxonomies participate in the multilingual experience, facilitating consistent term translations and relationships across different language sites.

By understanding and configuring these tabs, administrators can precisely control which types of content and taxonomies are eligible for translation, improving the management and user experience of their multilingual site.
