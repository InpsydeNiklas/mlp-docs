**Overview**:  
The **Translatable Post Types** tab in MultilingualPress settings displays all registered content types (post types) for which language relations can be created. By selecting specific post types here, you control which types of content can be linked and translated between languages.

**Key Points**:

- **Selection Impact**: Only post types marked as translatable will show the MultilingualPress translation metabox during post editing. For example, if only the default Posts are selected, the translation metabox will appear exclusively for posts, not for pages or custom post types.
- **Customization**: Administrators can tailor their multilingual workflow by enabling translations for only relevant content typesâ€”reducing clutter and focusing on the most important parts of the site.
- **Flexibility**: At any time, you can update these settings to include additional post types as your content strategy evolves.

**When to Use**:

- When you have multiple content types but only want certain ones to participate in multilingual linking.
- To improve editing efficiency by hiding translation options for non-selected types.

**Conclusion**:  
The **Translatable Post Types** tab gives you fine-grained control over which kinds of content are available for translation management, streamlining the editing process and ensuring consistency across your multilingual network.
