## Key Points

- **Continued Functionality**:  
    MultilingualPress will **continue to function normally** even if your subscription expires or is canceled. You won’t lose access to your existing multilingual features or content.
    
- **No Access to Updates**:  
    Without an active subscription, you will no longer receive:
    
    - **Plugin Updates**: New features, bug fixes, and security patches will not be available.
    - **Compatibility Improvements**: As WordPress and third-party tools evolve, updates often ensure compatibility with the latest versions.
- **No Premium Support**:  
    Expiration means you lose access to our **premium support services**:
    
    - No personalized help or troubleshooting assistance from our support team.
    - Queries through our support channels may not be prioritized or answered until renewal.
- **License Reminders**:  
    Without an active subscription, certain MultilingualPress settings and administrative pages may display notifications reminding you to renew your license. These reminders are designed to inform you of expired status and encourage renewal to regain support and updates.

## Common Concerns Addressed

### Do I have to renew my plan every year to continue using the plugin?

**No**, you do not need to renew to keep the plugin running. The functionality remains intact without renewal.

### What happens if I don't renew?

- The plugin will **still operate** as it did before, so your multilingual sites will remain live and functional.
- However, without renewal:
    - You **won't receive future updates**. Over time, this might lead to compatibility concerns with new versions of PHP, WordPress, or third-party plugins.
    - You **lose premium support**, meaning technical assistance and guidance from our specialist support team will no longer be available.
    - The system may display reminders or notifications about the inactive license status.

### Is renewal only for updates and support?

Yes. An active subscription primarily **secures access to ongoing updates and premium support**. Renewal isn’t required to maintain the core functionality of MultilingualPress on your network, but it is recommended to keep your plugin secure, up-to-date, and fully supported.

## Why Renew Your Subscription?

- **Compatibility**: Ensure your MultilingualPress installation remains compatible with the latest WordPress versions, themes, and plugins.
- **Support**: Gain peace of mind with access to expert advice and troubleshooting assistance when you need it.

## Summary
