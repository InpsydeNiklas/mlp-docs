**Key Points**:

- **Activation**:
    - The QuickLinks tab is visible only if the **Quicklink** module is activated in MultilingualPress global settings.
- **Position Options**:
    - Four radio buttons let you select the position of QuickLinks relative to post content (e.g., above content, below content, etc.).
- **Conditional Display**:
    - QuickLinks appear only when a translation exists for the current post, offering context-aware navigation.

**Purpose and Use**:

- **User Experience**:
    - QuickLinks give visitors immediate access to other language versions of a post without leaving the page.
- **Customization**:
    - Administrators can fine-tune where these links appear, balancing visibility with design preferences.

**Considerations**:

- QuickLinks are best for sites that want straightforward language navigation directly associated with content.
- Styling and additional customization are possible through CSS or additional configurations, but the core functionality focuses on positioning.

**Conclusion**:  
The QuickLinks settings allow admins to control simple, inline language navigation. By selecting a position and enabling QuickLinks, you can enhance user experience with minimal effort.
