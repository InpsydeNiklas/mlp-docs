# How Many MultilingualPress Licenses Do I Need?

**Short Answer**: Each **WordPress Multisite network** running **MultilingualPress** requires a **single license activation**, regardless of how many languages, subdomains, or sites you create within that network. With our new license model, you can choose either **Professional** (1 activation) or **Advanced** (5 activations). Neither license limits the number of languages or domains you can use in your multisite.

## New License Types

1. **Professional**:
    
    - Includes **1 activation**.
    - Ideal if you only run **one** WordPress Multisite network (unlimited sub-sites and languages).
2. **Advanced**:
    
    - Includes **5 activations**.
    - Designed for power users, agencies, or developers who manage **multiple** multisite networks—up to five—each of which can contain unlimited languages and domains.

### What Is “One Activation”?

- **One activation** refers to _one_ WordPress installation in “Multisite” mode.
- Even if you have 20 sub-sites (for 20 languages, for instance) under that one multisite network, it **still counts** as a single license activation.

## No Language or Domain Limits

**There is no limit** on how many languages, subdomains, or top-level domains you can link inside your multisite environment. This licensing approach:

- **Benefits Small and Large**: Whether you only need 2 languages or support 50+ languages, the price remains the same for that one network activation.
- **Scales Easily**: Add as many language sites, domain-mapped sub-sites, or specialized regional sites as you want—MultilingualPress won’t cap it or charge extra.

## Example Scenarios

1. **Single Multisite, 10 Languages**
    
    - You only have one WordPress Multisite, but plan to run 10 language sites within it.
    - **License**: Professional license (1 activation). It covers unlimited languages.
2. **Multiple Multisite Projects**
    
    - You manage multiple distinct clients or brands, each with its own separate multisite install (e.g., 3 separate networks).
    - **License**: If you need up to 5 separate multisites, choose the Advanced license (5 activations).
    - Each network can be spun up with unlimited sub-sites, languages, or domain mappings.
3. **Staging Environments**
    
    - For staging or development servers, we generally do **not** count it as an additional activation.
    - You can test new languages or features without affecting your primary license usage.

## What Does a License Provide?

- **All Features & Versions**
    
    - Each license unlocks the complete range of MultilingualPress functionalities, from site duplication to auto-translation integration (where available).
    - You also get updates for **all** major and minor releases, including Composer support if you need advanced workflows.
- **Personalized Support**
    
    - Access to our premium support system, ensuring help if you encounter issues with setup, domain mapping, or translation workflows.
    - The **Professional** and **Advanced** licenses come with the same top-tier support—just adapted to the number of multisite networks you manage.

## Summing It Up

- **One multisite = one license activation**. You can manage any number of sub-sites, languages, and domains within that network without incurring extra costs.
- **Professional License** covers **1** network activation (unlimited languages).
- **Advanced License** covers **5** network activations (unlimited languages each).
- **No constraints** on how many sub-sites or domain mappings you use inside a network.
- **Support & Updates**: Both license tiers include ongoing updates and dedicated customer support for the duration of your subscription.
