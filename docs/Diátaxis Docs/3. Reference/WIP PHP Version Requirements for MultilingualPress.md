**Scope**: This reference explains the minimum PHP version required to run MultilingualPress 5.0+ and why updating PHP is recommended.

---

### 1. Minimum PHP Version

- **Starting with MultilingualPress 5.0**, PHP **8.0** is required.
- Earlier versions of MultilingualPress (4.7.0+) already **require at least PHP 7.4**.

> **Important**: If your hosting environment runs a version **lower than PHP 8.0**, you must upgrade before installing or updating to MultilingualPress 5.0.

### 2. Why Update PHP?

1. **Security**: Newer PHP versions receive active security patches. Outdated versions are more vulnerable to attacks.
2. **Compatibility**: Core WordPress, WooCommerce, and other plugins now recommend or mandate higher versions (WordPress requires 7.4+, WooCommerce 7.4+).
3. **Performance**: Newer PHP versions handle code more efficiently, resulting in faster page loads.

### 3. How to Update PHP

- **Check Your Hosting Dashboard**: Some providers let you change the PHP version directly in cPanel, Plesk, or a custom admin panel.
- **Contact Your Hosting Provider**: If you can’t change the PHP version yourself, ask your provider’s support for assistance.
- **Backup Your Site**: Always create a full backup (files + database) before making any PHP version changes.

> **Note**: Updating PHP can cause compatibility issues if other site components are not up to date. Ensure all themes and plugins are compatible with your new PHP version.

### 4. Risks of Not Updating

- **No Future Support**: Older PHP versions will not be compatible with future MultilingualPress releases, so we cannot guarantee support.
- **Security & Stability**: Running outdated software makes your site prone to security breaches and crashes.
- **Performance Loss**: You may miss out on performance gains and improvements in newer PHP versions.
