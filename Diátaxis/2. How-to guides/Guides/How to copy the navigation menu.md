If you need to create a navigation menu in all subsites of your Multisite network, you don’t need to manually set them one by one: with MultilingualPress you can set the navigation menu once, and copy it to all subsites. This way creating a new menu is much easier and you save a lot of time.

Let’s see for example how is possible to add a language menu in a Multisite network with several language sites.

## Setting a language menu

As an example consider a Multisite with 3 subsites (English, Italian, German) related via MultilingualPress.

First of all, you need to set a language menu: set it as the main menu in the primary location.

Go in the English version site’s _Dashboard_, and from there head to _Appereance -> Menu_.

In that page leave the Menu Name as _main_. Then open the _Languages_ accordion menu, select the three available languages checkbox, and finally click on the _Add Menu_ button.

After that, click the _Save Menu_ button. The navigation menu is now available in the front end of the English site as shown in the picture below.

## Copy the language menu

Of course if you now navigate to the Italian and German sites, you still see the old main menu.

In order to update these too, you could perform the same actions described in the previous section.

But if you go in the _Dashboard_ of the Italian site, and then navigate to _Appearance -> Menu_, you can see a drop-down menu created by MultilingualPress: this lets you select a menu configuration from another site in the network and copy it to the current selected site.

So just select _main - Primary Menu_ related to the English version and then press the _Copy_ button.

Select _main – Primary Menu_ related to the English version and then press the _Copy_ button.

Perform the same actions also in the German version site.

This way all the sites have a Language menu with just a couple of clicks.

You can now use the navigation menu to reach any subsite in the Multisite network.
