# What Is WordPress Multisite?

**WordPress Multisite** is a powerful feature allowing you to manage multiple, independent websites from a single WordPress installation. Each site functions like its own WordPress instance, yet shares the same codebase, user accounts, and certain configuration files. This makes it especially valuable for organizing multilingual or multi-regional sites, streamlining maintenance, and reducing the need for separate WordPress installations.

## Key Benefits

1. **Unified Installation**
    
    - All sites share core WordPress files, themes, and plugins. Updating WordPress or adding a plugin once can apply to every site in the network.
2. **Scalable Network**
    
    - Seamlessly host tens—or even hundreds—of sites under one installation. This is ideal for organizations, universities, franchises, or multilingual businesses.
3. **Dedicated Language Sites**
    
    - In combination with a plugin like [MultilingualPress](https://multilingualpress.org/), you can assign each language version to its own subsite. This keeps translated content clean, separated, and easier to manage.
4. **Flexible Site Customization**
    
    - Each subsite can have unique content, design, or features—even though they all share the same WordPress code. A Super Admin decides what resources (themes, plugins) each local site can access.
5. **Centralized User Management**
    
    - All sites share the user tables, simplifying account creation and permissions. Network admins (Super Admins) can oversee user roles across multiple sites, while local admins manage content on their own subsite.

## Setting Up a Multisite

### Subdirectory vs. Subdomain vs. Domain Mapping

- **Subdirectories**: e.g., `example.com/en` or `example.com/de`.
- **Subdomains**: e.g., `en.example.com`, `de.example.com`.
- **Domain Mapping**: Map unique domains or subdomains (e.g., `example.de`) to a subsite. See the official [WordPress Multisite Domain Mapping](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/multisite/domain-mapping/) documentation for details.

### Server Requirements

- **Rewrite Rules**: Must be enabled. Confirm your hosting environment meets the [Multisite server requirements](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/multisite/prepare-network/#server-requirements).
- **Installation**: Refer to the [How to Install and Set Up WordPress Multisite](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/how-to-install-wordpress-multisite/) guide for a step-by-step tutorial.

## Differences from Single-Site WordPress

1. **Network Administration Layer**
    
    - A **Network Admin** dashboard appears once multisite is enabled.
    - A **Super Admin** can install themes and plugins, create subsites, and manage network-wide user roles.
2. **Files and Configuration**
    
    - Extra lines in `wp-config.php` and `.htaccess` handle subdomains or subdirectories.
    - Each subsite keeps its own uploads folder inside `wp-content/uploads/`.
3. **Database Structure**
    
    - Standard WordPress uses about 12 tables. Multisite duplicates 10 of these tables for each subsite, keeping data for each site isolated while sharing the users and usermeta tables.
    - As you add more sites, you multiply table sets accordingly.
4. **Role Limitations**
    
    - Website Administrators: Manage local site content but can’t install new themes/plugins.
    - Super Admin: Oversees the entire network, controlling global installations and network settings.

## Typical Use Cases & Next Steps

While this article focuses on the fundamental concept of Multisite, you can explore **common real-world use cases** in detail by reading [WordPress Multisite for Different Scenarios](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-p-677ffd6da894819197dd7cf3a90d93fa-mlp-docs/c/6780001b-80d8-8011-8739-903a6ccdb99d?model=o1#). That guide delves into how global brands, universities, agencies, and e-commerce stores leverage Multisite, often in tandem with **MultilingualPress**.

- **Global or Regional Sites**: Create localized content for each region or language.
- **Enterprise-Level Deployments**: Manage dozens (or hundreds) of sites under a unified codebase.
- **University Departments**: Provide separate departmental sites within one installation, simplifying updates and security.
- **Agency Hosting**: Maintain multiple client sites efficiently, controlling plugin and theme availability network-wide.

## Why Use Multisite for Multilingual?

When paired with **MultilingualPress**, each language gets its own subsite, ensuring:

1. **Clean Separation of Content**: No shortcodes or custom structures “locking” your translations into a single site.
2. **Better Performance**: Each site is independent in the database, preventing the bloat or conflicts that can arise with single-site multilingual plugins.
3. **No Lock-In**: If you disable MultilingualPress, each subsite remains intact, preserving all language content.

## Conclusion

WordPress Multisite introduces an additional administrative layer and database structure to handle multiple sites in a single installation. It’s particularly beneficial for organizations or individuals needing scalability, centralized management, or multilingual solutions. By understanding multisite’s differences from single-site WordPress—especially how network administration, file structure, and database tables evolve—you can harness its advantages for complex site networks.
