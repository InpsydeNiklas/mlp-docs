Are you currently building a [WordPress multisite](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/how-to-install-wordpress-multisite/) network? Do you already have one and are looking for plugins to equip your network with additional features? Then it’s inevitable that you will deal with the question of WordPress multisite compatible plugins. That's because  you cannot use all plugins within a multisite.

Now we will explain how you can tell whether a WordPress plugin is compatible with the multisite feature or not. Moreover, we provide a long list of plugins that we update regularly.

## How do I know whether a plugin is compatible with WordPress multisite?

Generally, the plugin description mentions compatibility with WordPress multisite if it is compatible. For free plugins, you can find this description at [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/). Nevertheless, you can divide a plugin’s compatibility with WordPress multisite into three categories:

1. a) **non-compatible** **–** The plugin delivers an error message during installation or activation in a WordPress multisite. You definitely cannot use these plugins in a multisite. For many of these plugins, there is nothing in the plugin description about multisite compatibility.
2. b) **passively compatible** **–** You can use the plugin in the multisite without causing errors but the plugin author didn't specifically develop the plugin as a multisite plugin. You can use these plugins in the multisite, but you should exercise caution if the plugin author does not specifically indicate multisite compatibility in the description.
3. c) **actively compatible** **–** These plugins are always referred to as multisite compatible in the description. These are a safe option for you.

If you are not sure, it’s best to contact the plugin author.
