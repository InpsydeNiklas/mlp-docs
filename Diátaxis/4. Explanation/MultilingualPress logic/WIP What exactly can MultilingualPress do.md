# What Exactly Can MultilingualPress Do?

**MultilingualPress** is a powerful tool that transforms a standard WordPress Multisite into a comprehensive multilingual network. It not only facilitates content translation but also establishes robust language connections between various sites, ensuring visitors and search engines can easily detect, navigate, and manage content across multiple languages. This makes it especially valuable for global brand management and serving specialized content to different markets.

### Establishing Language Connections

At its core, **MultilingualPress** links **different language versions** of your website as separate sites within a WordPress Multisite network. Each site hosts content in a specific language—such as English, French, German, etc.—and MultilingualPress establishes connections between them. This allows for:

- **Content is Linked and Translated**: Posts, pages, custom post types, and taxonomies (such as categories and tags) across different language sites are connected. This linking makes sure that each piece of content is available in multiple languages and remains easily translatable across sites.
- **Independent Content Management**: Each language site maintains its own content, users, and settings. MultilingualPress manages the relationships between them. This allows you to tailor content and features for specific languages or regions without affecting other sites, which is ideal for serving specialized content to different markets.

### Enhancing User Experience and SEO

MultilingualPress enhances both user experience and search engine optimization:

- **Automatic hreflang Implementation**: By linking translations, MultilingualPress automatically inserts correct **hreflang** tags, informing search engines of language and regional targeting. This prevents duplicate content issues and ensures that search engines serve the correct language version to users.
- **Language Detection and Redirection**: MultilingualPress can automatically detect a visitor’s preferred language—whether by browser settings or geolocation—and redirect them to the appropriate language version of your site.
- **Language Switchers**: The plugin includes tools like language menu blocks, widgets, and quicklinks that allow visitors to easily switch between language versions, improving navigation and accessibility.

### Global Brand Management and Specialized Content

MultilingualPress is not just a translation tool; it creates a **multilingual network** across multiple sites connected together. This offers significant advantages over traditional multilingual solutions:

- **Global Brand Management**: Brands can manage separate language-specific websites under one network, which allows for consistent branding while tailoring content to regional markets.
- **Specialized Content**: Each language site can host its own specialized content, promotions, or regional products while remaining part of the same unified network.
- **Centralized Control, Distributed Content**: Each site operates independently, with its own content and settings, but MultilingualPress links these sites to ensure smooth navigation, translation management, and SEO optimization across languages.
