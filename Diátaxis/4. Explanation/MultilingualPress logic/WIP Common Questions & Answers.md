## 1. General & Licensing

You can purchase licenses at [multilingualpress.org](https://multilingualpress.org/) or via the official [WooCommerce Marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/products/multilingualpress/). The plugin is the same regardless of where you purchase it.

<!-- Note: Reworded for conciseness. Removed redundant information about license purchase options. -->

### **Do You Offer a Refund Guarantee?**
Yes. We offer a **30-day money-back guarantee**. If MultilingualPress doesn’t meet your needs, you can request a refund within 30 days.

<!-- Note: Reworded for brevity and removed extra wording. "Simply request a refund" was condensed to a more direct form. -->

### **What Kind of Support Do I Get?**
Purchasing a license entitles you to **premium support** through our ticket system. Support is available during business hours (Mon–Fri, 9am–5pm UTC+1). Submit your queries via the [support portal](https://multilingualpress.org/support/).

<!-- Note: Condensed "typical response time" detail and emphasized the support portal for better clarity. -->

## 2. Requirements & Compatibility

### **Which WordPress & PHP Versions Are Needed?**
We recommend using **WordPress 6.5** or higher, with **PHP 8.0+** (or preferably the latest stable version). This ensures optimal performance and compatibility with MultilingualPress.

<!-- Note: Minor rewording for clarity and emphasis on optimal performance. -->

### **Do I Need a WordPress Multisite?**
Yes. MultilingualPress requires **WordPress Multisite** to function, as each language will be set up on its own subsite. If you're new to multisite, refer to our guide on [How to Install WordPress Multisite](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/how-to-install-wordpress-multisite/).

<!-- Note: Reworded to make it clearer that a multisite installation is required, with a link to installation instructions. -->

### **Does It Work with WP Multisite Domain Mapping?**
Yes, MultilingualPress fully supports **WordPress Multisite Domain Mapping**, a core feature since WordPress 4.5.

<!-- Note: Simplified to mention only essential details about domain mapping support. -->

### **Is MultilingualPress Compatible with the Block Editor (Gutenberg)?**
Yes, **MultilingualPress 3.0+** fully supports the **Block Editor (Gutenberg)**. It also remains compatible with the **Classic Editor**, should you choose to keep it enabled.

<!-- Note: Reworded for clarity. Emphasis on the version and compatibility with both editors. -->

### **What About Page Builders Like Elementor or Beaver Builder?**
MultilingualPress integrates seamlessly with popular page builders like **Elementor**, **Beaver Builder**, and **WPBakery**. You can easily link or duplicate page-builder-created content across your language sites. However, some specialized fields may require manual adjustments or additional configuration.

<!-- Note: Made more concise and clearer, focusing on core integration with page builders. -->

## 3. Features & Functionality

### **Does MultilingualPress Translate My Content Automatically?**
MultilingualPress doesn’t translate content automatically by default. It links separate language sites within your multisite network. You can manage translations manually or use professional translation tools. Starting with **MLP 5.0**, we’re introducing the **AutoTranslate** feature, integrating with third-party APIs (e.g., Google Translate, Deepl) to automate text translation.

<!-- Note: Condensed and added a more direct mention of the upcoming **AutoTranslate** feature. -->

### **How Do I Create a New Language Site?**
To create a new language site, go to **Network Admin → Sites → Add New**, select the language and site to base the new one on. You can also choose to **“Activate all plugins that are active on the source site”** or **“Copy attachments”**. Our [Getting Started guide](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/getting-started-with-multilingualpress-3/) has step-by-step instructions.

<!-- Note: Reworded for clarity and provided a more streamlined explanation. Added a link to the getting started guide. -->

### **Can I Copy Media Automatically Between Sites?**
Yes. When duplicating a page or an entire site, you can select **“Copy attachments”**. MultilingualPress will duplicate media files (like images and galleries) to the target site’s media library and automatically update the URLs.

<!-- Note: Made it more concise and clearer. -->

### **What About SEO & Translations?**
MultilingualPress includes an **SEO meta sync** module that works with popular SEO plugins (e.g., Yoast, Rank Math). It allows you to edit SEO meta fields (title, description, etc.) across languages from a single location. Additionally, **hreflang** attributes are automatically inserted to help improve multilingual SEO.

<!-- Note: Rewritten for simplicity and clarity, with focus on key SEO features and tools. -->

### **How About Stock Synchronization in WooCommerce?**
Each WooCommerce site within your multisite network operates as a separate store, which means product stock isn’t shared by default. To synchronize stock across sites, consider using the [Central Stock for WooCommerce](https://wp-centralstock.com/) plugin.

<!-- Note: Simplified and emphasized the use of external plugins for stock synchronization. -->

## 4. WooCommerce & MultilingualPress

### **Is MultilingualPress Compatible with WooCommerce?**
Yes. You can translate products, product categories, and tags across languages. Each language site maintains its own WooCommerce settings (currency, shipping, taxes). For more details, see our [WooCommerce tutorial](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/getting-started-with-multilingualpress-3/?#Translating-WooCommerce-products).

<!-- Note: Rewritten for clarity, focusing on WooCommerce translation capabilities. Added link to the tutorial for further details. -->

### **Does MultilingualPress Convert Product Prices?**
No, MultilingualPress doesn’t handle price conversion. Pricing must be managed individually on each store, or you can use a currency conversion plugin to adjust prices. MultilingualPress focuses on linking translations, not currency conversion.

<!-- Note: Simplified to focus on core information about price management and currency conversion. -->

### **Is the Shopping Cart Shared Across Languages?**
No, each language site has its own shopping cart. This means that items added to the cart in the English store won't appear in the French store’s cart. Most users prefer this setup for handling separate checkouts per region or language.

<!-- Note: Reworded to clarify that carts are independent by default and that it's a preferred setup for many users. -->

### **Any Differences Between Buying on WooCommerce.com vs. MultilingualPress.org?**
There is no difference in the plugin itself or the support you’ll receive, regardless of whether you buy from WooCommerce.com or multilingualpress.org.

<!-- Note: Simplified to remove redundant phrases. -->

## 5. Upgrades & Versions

### **What About Old Versions Like MultilingualPress 2?**
Legacy versions (such as MLP 2) are no longer actively developed. They only receive minimal security updates. We recommend upgrading to **MLP 3.0+** for better performance, block editor support, and ongoing improvements. Migration tools are available [here](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/multilingualpress-2-3-migration-tool/).

<!-- Note: Shortened for clarity and emphasized the importance of upgrading. Added link to migration tools. -->

### **Does the AutoTranslate Feature Require an Extra License?**
The basic **AutoTranslate** feature is included in **MLP 5.0**. Usage fees may depend on the translation API provider you select.

<!-- Note: Clarified that the AutoTranslate feature is included in the core plugin. -->

## 6. Support & Resources

### **How Do I Contact Support?**
