## 1. General & Licensing

### **Is MultilingualPress Free or Premium?**

MultilingualPress is available as a **premium** plugin. There is no free version maintained on WordPress.org. You can purchase licenses at [multilingualpress.org](https://multilingualpress.org/) or via the official [WooCommerce Marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/products/multilingualpress/). The plugin is the same regardless of where you buy it.

### **Do You Offer a Refund Guarantee?**

Yes. We provide a **30-day money-back guarantee**. If MultilingualPress doesn’t fit your needs, simply request a refund within that window.

### **What Kind of Support Do I Get?**

Buying a license entitles you to **premium support** through our ticket system. Our team typically responds within business hours (Mon–Fri, 9am–5pm UTC+1).

## 2. Requirements & Compatibility

### **Which WordPress & PHP Versions Are Needed?**

We recommend **WordPress 6.5** or higher, with **PHP 8.0+** (or preferably the latest stable PHP). This ensures compatibility and top performance.

### **Do I Need a WordPress Multisite?**

Yes. MultilingualPress requires **WordPress Multisite** to function, as each language is given its own subsite. If you’re new to multisite, check our [How to Install WordPress Multisite](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/how-to-install-wordpress-multisite/) guide.

### **Does It Work with WP Multisite Domain Mapping?**

Absolutely. Domain Mapping is a core WordPress feature for multisite as of WordPress 4.5, and MultilingualPress supports it seamlessly.

### **Is MultilingualPress Ready for the Block Editor (Gutenberg)?**

Yes. Modern versions of MultilingualPress (3.0+) fully support the **WordPress block editor**. We also remain compatible with the **Classic Editor** if you choose to keep that enabled.

### **What About Page Builders Like Elementor or Beaver Builder?**

MultilingualPress integrates with popular page builders (Elementor, Beaver Builder, WPBakery, etc.). You can link or duplicate page-builder-created content across your language sites. Some specialized fields in these builders may require manual checks or additional configuration.

## 3. Features & Functionality

### **Does MultilingualPress Translate My Content Automatically?**

By default, MultilingualPress **doesn’t translate** texts. It links separate language sites on a multisite, letting you manage translations manually or with professional tools. However, **starting in MLP 5.0**, we’re introducing an **AutoTranslate** feature, integrating with third-party APIs (e.g., Google or Deepl) to automate text translation.

### **How Do I Create a New Language Site?**

Within **Network Admin → Sites → Add New**, you choose a new language and which site to base the new one on. If you wish, you can **“Activate all plugins that are active on the source site”** or **“Copy attachments”** to duplicate media and settings. Our [Getting Started guide](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/getting-started-with-multilingualpress-3/) has step-by-step instructions.

### **Can I Copy Media Automatically Between Sites?**

Yes. When duplicating a page or entire site, you can choose **“Copy attachments”**. MultilingualPress will duplicate media files for **core WordPress blocks** (like images or galleries) to the target site’s library and update URLs accordingly.

### **What About SEO & Translations?**

MultilingualPress has a **SEO meta sync** module (for Yoast, Rank Math, and others) that lets you edit certain meta fields (title, description, etc.) across languages from a single place. hreflang attributes are automatically inserted for connected content, aiding with multilingual SEO.

### **How about Stock Synchronization in WooCommerce?**

If you run **WooCommerce** across multiple language sites, each site is a separate store by default. If you want **shared stock** across these stores, consider the [Central Stock for WooCommerce](https://wp-centralstock.com/) plugin.

## 4. WooCommerce & MultilingualPress

### **Is MultilingualPress Compatible with WooCommerce?**

Yes. You can translate products, product categories, and tags—any custom post type or taxonomy. Each language site runs its own WooCommerce settings (currency, shipping, taxes). For advanced details, see our [WooCommerce tutorial](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/getting-started-with-multilingualpress-3/?#Translating-WooCommerce-products).

### **Does MultilingualPress Convert Product Prices?**

No. You handle pricing individually on each store, or with a dedicated currency conversion plugin. MultilingualPress focuses on linking translations, not changing currency values.

### **Is the Shopping Cart Shared Across Languages?**

By default, each language site’s cart is independent. This means if a user puts items in the English store cart, those items don’t appear in the French store cart. Most site owners prefer separate checkouts by region or language.

### **Any Differences Buying at WooCommerce.com vs. MultilingualPress.org?**

None. The plugin is identical, and support is provided by us either way.

## 5. Upgrades & Versions

### **What About Old Versions Like MultilingualPress 2?**

Legacy versions (like MLP 2) are no longer actively developed, receiving only minimal security fixes. We highly recommend upgrading to **MLP 3.0+** for better performance, block editor integration, and ongoing improvements. We have [migration tools](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/multilingualpress-2-3-migration-tool/) if needed.

### **Does the AutoTranslate Feature Require an Extra License?**

Starting in **MLP 5.0**, basic auto-translation is part of the core plugin, connecting to third-party translation services. Usage fees may depend on your chosen translation API’s pricing model.

## 6. Support & Resources

### **How Do I Contact Support?**

You must have a **valid license** to open support tickets. Once logged in to your customer account, go to [MultilingualPress Support](https://multilingualpress.org/support/) and submit your ticket. We offer support in English and German.

### **Any Documentation for Beginners?**

Yes. Our docs cover everything from [installing WordPress Multisite](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/how-to-install-wordpress-multisite/) to [getting started with MLP](https://multilingualpress.org/docs/getting-started-with-multilingualpress-3/).
