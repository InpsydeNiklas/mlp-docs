Managing a multilingual website involves a series of routine activities that span site creation, content publishing, and translation linking. MultilingualPress streamlines these tasks across a WordPress Multisite network, allowing authors and administrators to efficiently coordinate content in multiple languages. This article provides an overview of common activities and explains how MultilingualPress facilitates them, without delving into step-by-step instructions.

### Adding New Sites and Languages

**Context**: In a WordPress Multisite configured with MultilingualPress, each language typically corresponds to a separate site within the network.

**Routine Activity**:

- **Creating a New Language Site**: Administrators add a new site to the multisite network when expanding into a new language or region. They set the site’s language, link it with existing sites, and configure initial settings.

**How MultilingualPress Helps**:

- It provides dedicated settings (e.g., language selection, relationships, redirection options) during site creation, making it easier to set up connections between language versions.
- Once sites are connected, content and navigation elements (like menus and comments) can be shared, linked, or synchronized across these sites.

**Benefit**: This approach allows global brands to manage distinct language sites while maintaining a cohesive network, ensuring consistency and scalability even when serving over 20 languages.

### Publishing New Content in Multiple Languages

**Context**: Content authors often create posts, pages, or products on their primary site and then need to translate or replicate that content for additional language sites.

**Routine Activity**:

- **Publishing Content**: Authors write and publish a new piece of content on the source site.
- **Managing Translations**: Using MultilingualPress translation metaboxes, they link this content to corresponding versions on other language sites.

**How MultilingualPress Helps**:

- **Translation Metaboxes**: At the bottom of the post/page editor, metaboxes for each connected language allow authors to create new translations, link existing content, or copy specific data (like categories, tags, and WooCommerce product details).
- **Synchronization Features**: For various content types (e.g., posts, products), MultilingualPress provides specialized tabs and options to copy metadata, connect comments, or replicate media, streamlining the translation process.

**Benefit**: Authors can manage translations for multiple languages from a single interface, reducing manual duplication and ensuring consistency across language versions. The workflow remains intuitive even as the number of languages and content pieces increases.

### Coordinating Multilingual Comments and Reviews

**Context**: Beyond content, user-generated elements like comments and WooCommerce reviews add value to a multilingual site. They need to be handled appropriately across language versions.

**Routine Activity**:

- **Linking Comments**: When a comment is posted on one language version, it can be connected or copied to corresponding posts on other language sites.
- **Bulk Operations**: Administrators can bulk copy comments to maintain consistency across translations, especially when synchronizing discussions or reviews.

**How MultilingualPress Helps**:

- It extends its relational framework to comments and WooCommerce reviews, allowing for both individual comment linking through metaboxes and bulk copying through settings.
- This ensures that user interactions remain coherent across languages, contributing to a unified community experience.

### Overall Management and Benefits

**Integrated Workflow**: MultilingualPress ties together the separate tasks of site creation, content publishing, and content linking into an integrated workflow. It leverages WordPress Multisite’s architecture to handle each language as a separate site while providing tools to connect and manage these sites collectively.

**SEO and Navigation**: The plugin automatically handles SEO-related elements like hreflang tags, and provides multiple options for language switchers, ensuring that visitors can easily navigate between language versions and that search engines understand the relationships between content.

**Scalability and Compatibility**:

- **Scalability**: Because each language is a separate site, MultilingualPress scales well for enterprise-level deployments, supporting numerous languages without degrading performance.
- **Compatibility**: The plugin works with any other plugin that is multisite-compatible, ensuring a broad ecosystem support. The routine tasks described integrate smoothly with other WordPress features, like menus, custom fields, and e-commerce functionalities.
