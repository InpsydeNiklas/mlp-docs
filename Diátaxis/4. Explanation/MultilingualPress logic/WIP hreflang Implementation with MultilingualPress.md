### What is hreflang and why does it matter for SEO?

**hreflang** is an HTML attribute used in `<link rel="alternate">` tags placed in a page’s `<head>`. It tells search engines which languages and regions a page is intended for, helping serve the correct language version to users and preventing duplicate content issues. Proper hreflang usage can improve user experience, search visibility, and prevent SEO penalties related to duplicate content.

### How does hreflang work with MultilingualPress?

**MultilingualPress automates hreflang implementation.** Once you link translations of your content across language sites using MultilingualPress:

- The plugin **automatically inserts hreflang tags** in the `<head>` section of each page.
- These tags reflect the connected language versions of your content, guiding search engines to serve the right pages based on user language preferences.

**Key Point:**  
You don't need to manually add or configure hreflang tags. Simply ensure that your translations are properly connected in MultilingualPress, and hreflang is handled for you.

### Why is correct hreflang implementation important?

- **Language Targeting**: Search engines can show users the appropriate language version of your content.
- **Duplicate Content Prevention**: Proper hreflang tags distinguish similar pages in different languages, avoiding duplicate content penalties.
- **User Experience**: By serving the correct language, visitors are more likely to engage with your content.

### How can I test if hreflang is working correctly?

1. **Use hreflang Validators**: Tools like [SISTRIX’s hreflang validator](https://www.sistrix.com/ask-sistrix/hreflang/) can check the correctness of hreflang tags.
