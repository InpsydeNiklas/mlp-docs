## What is hreflang and why does it matter for SEO?

**hreflang** is an HTML attribute used in `<link rel="alternate">` tags in a page's `<head>`. It informs search engines about which languages and regions a page is intended for. This helps search engines serve the correct language version of your page to users and prevents issues with duplicate content.

Using hreflang correctly can:
- **Improve user experience**: Ensuring that users are directed to the version of the page in their preferred language.
- **Boost search visibility**: Helping search engines understand your multilingual content, which can lead to better rankings in relevant regions.
- **Prevent SEO penalties**: Proper implementation avoids duplicate content issues across different language versions of the same page.

<!-- Note: Simplified the language around hreflang benefits. Reduced SEO jargon, made it clearer for general users. -->

## How can I test if hreflang is working correctly?

1. **Use hreflang Validators**: Tools like [SISTRIX’s hreflang validator](https://www.sistrix.com/ask-sistrix/hreflang/) allow you to check whether hreflang tags are correctly implemented on your pages.
2. **Inspect Page Source**: Open the page in your browser, right-click, and select **View Page Source**. Look for `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="...">` tags in the `<head>` section to confirm they reflect the connected translations.
3. **Review Google’s Guidelines**: Check [Google’s hreflang documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/localized-versions) for best practices and troubleshooting advice.

### Example:
If you have an English page (`example.com/en/`) and a French version (`example.com/fr/`), the hreflang tags should look like this:

<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://example.com/en/" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="fr" href="https://example.com/fr/" />
