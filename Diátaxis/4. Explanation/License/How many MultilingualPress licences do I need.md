**Note**: MultilingualPress can only be used in a multisite. The language sites you want to connect together need to be in the same multisite. MultilingualPress doesn't work with single site.

### Our License model

**Every licence allows you to set a fixed number of languages across a fixed number of Multisites.**

For customers who need to build several multilingual websites and shops, we offer cheaper license packages.

Currently, we offer 3 packages:

**Standard** - for 3 languages in 1 Multisite, $99  
**Pro** - for 6 languages across 3 or less Multisites, $299  
**Agency** - for 18 languages across 9 or less Multisites, $599

### Standard license example

If you have 1 Multisite and you want to set it with 3 language sub sites, you will need the Standard package.

### Pro license example

If you have 2 Multisites and you want to set both of them with 2 language sub sites, you will need the Pro package, since you will need to manage 4 languages in the 2 Multisites.

### Agency license example

If you have 3 Multisites and you want to set the first with 2, the second with 3 and the third with 4 language sub sites, you will need the Agency package, since you will need to manage 9 languages in the 3 Multisites.

**Note**: In case you use a staging environment, the limit on the number of languages is not applied. Hence you can set your staging server with all the languages you need, regardless the configuration set up in the production environment.
